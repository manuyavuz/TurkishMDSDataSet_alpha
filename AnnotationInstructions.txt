Thanks for contributing to create this turkish multi document summary database!

A set of documents about a particular event or topic are given to you. Documents are gathered from news articles from different sources. 

TO DO:

1)
 You will create a short multi-document summary of the entire document
 set. A short summary should not be longer than 120 words. We will chop off words beyond
 the 120th, so please do not include more than 120.

2) Within the size limits, you should try to represent ALL the content 
 of the document set to some degree. 

3) Do not include your subjective opinions, rather summarise the documents in an objective manner. 

Feel free to use your own words.
